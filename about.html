            <h3>The problem</h3>
            <br>
            <p> “Nearly 50 percent of new teachers leave the profession within their first five years” - Department of
                Education

                Teacher burnout is worsening. And while there are a myriad of reasons for why, one prominent issue is
                the lack of teacher autonomy. From standardized tests to inadequate resources, education is dealing with
                a crisis of unparalleled magnitude. </p>
            <br>
            <h3>The Solution</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We listen, we provide, we improve. </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our process is a simple one: we work directly with teachers all over the country to address the issues
                of over-packed teacher schedules, lack of resources, and inadequate counseling they are faced with
                everyday. We work to change policies and laws not only for the betterment of our teachers but for the
                success of our children.</p>
